# Gate Simulator
# dvl1000_ros
ROS package, based on python, to read data from the Nortek DVL1000 and feed it to ROS

## Without compiling
You could simply navigate to the Exports folder and download the compiled versions of the software if you're not interested in customizing the software or have any other need to recompile it all over.




# Customizing the softtware
The software is developed with Godot, an open source Game Engine. Simply clone the repository and open the "project.godot" file with Godot.



## Usage
The software makes it possible to get more realistic images that can be used for training your neural network towards the Gate-related task. The images used in the simulator were particularly aimed at Robosub 2020.

Simply run the binary file. Use your left mouse button to change the angles, and scroll-wheel to zoom in and out. The rest should be self-explanatory.
